**No.1 [Spatially Resolved Stellar Populations of $0.3<z<6.0$ Galaxies in WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70 Clusters as Revealed by JWST: How do Galaxies Grow and Quench Over Cosmic Time?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02209)(update:2023/02/10)**
**Aims**: To get hints on the assembly of galaxy structures over cosmic time, especially how galaxies build their stellar masses and quench their star formation activities. 
*As we all know, star formation rate density can be viewed as a function of time t.  But galaxy won't monotonically growing with time, some physical process would shut down star formation and move them onto the 'quenched' population.*

**Method**:  HST/ACS and WFC3 +JWST /NIRCam(WHL0137-08 and MACS0647+70 cluster ), PIXEDFIT extracting the spatially resolved SEDs of sample galaxies, then fitted with models to infer the underlying properties of the stellar populations.  radial profiles of some key stellar population properties, comparison between the compactness of the spatial distributions of SFR and M∗, and Σ∗,1kpc–M∗ relation. Σ∗(r) profiles have a negative gradient . 

**Result**: Classification method is consistent with that based on the Hubble time.  More massive galaxies tend to have higher normalization of Σ∗(r) than less massive ones. More star-forming galaxies tend to have a larger half-mass radius than quiescent galaxies in all masses.

**No.2 [Density Structure of Centrally Concentrated Prestellar Cores from Multi-scale Observations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07634)(update:2021/02/17)**

Aims: Determining the density profile of prestellar cores, therefore provides an important opportunity to gauge the initial conditions of star formation.  As the 1st stage of  star formation, characterizing their density profile and temperature profiles is the key to exploring the physical processes of star formation.

Method: Assume an isothermal core with uniform temperature of 10 K. Use multi-scale Obs data(0.85 mm of James Clerk Maxwell Telescope and 1.3 mm of ALMA), extract the density profile of each observed core,  then determine the outer boundary R by fitting the radial profile, the other parameters estimated by $\chi^2$ fitting. 

Result: In the central region of the cores, the density is presumably higher and the temperature may be lower due to efficient dust continuum cooling. $1×10^7 cm{−3} , 500 au, 11000 au$ ,  $3×10^6 cm^{−3} , 1300 au, 17000 au$ and  $5×10^6 cm^{−3} , 300 au, 7000 au$, respectively, for G205M3, G209N and G212N1.  The sizes of the flat regions imply that the cores are unstable and gravitationally collapsing or on the verge of collapse. The density profile can't be simply described by a single power law $r^{\alpha}$ . Different protostellar cores usually exhibit various steepness.

忽然想到一个好笑的事情, 宇宙学的人用观测数据做出第一步的科学: Ⅰa 超星系的距离阶梯, 以及一些星系或者quasar 的红移信息, 然后是做宇宙学模型的就利用一级科学产品(上述的距离阶梯数据之类的)去做第二步科学, 然后来检验宇宙学模型. 问题来了, 当第一步就出现问题时候, 那第二步的东西还有多少可以相信,第二部的科学是否可以做, Hubble也没干过巡天的事情, 已知的高红移星系分布误差有多大? 光谱红移至少在peak(z~2) 附近还是可信的,这是物理过程(第一代恒星形成之后形成星系的时间大约).再高可能就不得行了. 

**No.6 [On an early -Post-AGB Instability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11374v1) (update:2023/3/24)**

**Aims:**  systematize the few proof-of-concept results here to stake the effects of such pulsations on the properties of post-AGB stars, their circumstellar neighborhood, and – most of all – to find out if such pulsations are compatible with the extensive, intricate web of observational constraints.

本报告旨在吸引AGB天体物理学专家的注意，他们可以获得足够的计算能力来仔细研究和系统地处理这里提出的几个概念证明结果，以确定这种脉动对后AGB恒星的性质、它们的星周环境的影响，并且最重要的是，找出这种脉动是否与广泛而复杂的观测限制相兼容。

**Method:**  Use MESA to compute stellar models. (Compared with tradition way, it consider the velocity term in the momentum equation)

**Q & A:**  
1. the evolutionary computations were found to terminate either due to too short timesteps or failing convergence of MESA once the amplitude of the pulsation grows too large
2. For Pop I, the higher the starting mass of the model stars is, the easier it seems for them to pick up rapidly-growing pulsations.
3. For Pop II stars, early – post AGB pulsations are harder to find than in Pop I models.
4. The pulsation does not grow out of computational noise but gets initiated by a small but finite amplitude-kick, which is likely picked up during the numerical relaxation process
5. Energy of the star is of the order of $10^{49}$ erg. the initial pulsational motion with its $5\times 10^{38}$  erg
6. These deeper layers do not participate in the oscillatory motion but only shrink monotonously. The contraction magnitude decreases with mass depth and vanishes before the outer edge of the H-burning shell is reached.
7. Matter and radiation are likely out of equilibrium so that a radiation-hydrodynamic treatment of the problem is called for.
8. thermal and dynamical timescales become comparable and the distinction between acoustic and thermal modes gets ever more difficult to maintain
**No.7 [Detection Rate of <50-meter Interstellar Objects with LSST](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.14766) (update:2023/4/7)**

**Aims:**  The observed interstellar meteors have also demonstrated interesting properties of scientific interest, including unusual material strength. Furthermore, small ISOs could be evidence of extraterrestrial equipment,

**Method:**  First, we determine the maximum distance at which an ISO is detectable by LSST as a function of its diameter.(第一步确定ISO的可探测尺寸)
we estimate the crossing rate of ISOs through the observable region based on their inferred density to determine the rate(第二步估算给定半径大小后,基于其数密度在可观测区域的穿过概率多大)
Finally, we show how the estimated detection rate of objects with LSST varies by object diameter and albedo,(最后给出LSST对于不同尺寸的ISO的探测概率)

Assumption: ISOs have the same velocity dispersion as local stars around the LSR (velocity distribution of the objects does not depend on the object albedo or diameter)

**Aims:** 

The evolutionary stellar mass of the MP population is smaller than the MR. Therefore, the MP population tends to exhibit more spatially extended distribution than the MR during the dynamical evolution of M92 if the initial radial distributions of both the MP and MR were similar.

**No.11 [Multi-Epoch Machine Learning 2: Identifying physical drivers of galaxy properties in simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07728v1) (update:2023/6/16)**
**Aims:** Use machine learning to explore the relative importance of different input properties in galaxy evolve  simulation, and compare the results between various simulations and subgrid models.

**Method**:  They use an ensemble of decision trees called random forest regressor to make predictions based on input properties.  They also consider the impact of other branches that merge in the simulation. The output for all models is the subhalo’s baryonic properties at redshift zero. They compare the result between different simulations to understand the relative importance of input Properties.

**Result:** The paper concludes that machine learning can be a powerful tool for predicting galaxy properties in cosmological simulations. The authors find that the relative importance of different input properties varies between simulations and subgrid models, highlighting the importance of accurately simulating physical processes in galaxy formation. The paper also presents a method for analyzing the relative importance of physical processes in galaxy formation simulations, which can be used to identify what observations can be used to distinguish simulations and to calibrate subgrid models. Overall, the paper provides insights into the physical processes driving galaxy formation and highlights the importance of subgrid models in accurately simulating these processes..

**No.14 Test cuspy core pro (update:2023/9/5)**
解决星系观测遇到的 cuspy&core 和missing satellite 问题, 可选方案有: 观测完备度不足, 恒星形成率在低质量晕较低,所以数量就少了?  或者潮汐作用在一些 plunging orbits(这个我没懂). 前者pro 可以是由于气体内流和外流导致的动力学加热来解决,或者由于大质量星团或者伴星星系的动力学扰动导致. 而当下一个吸引人的观测现象是近邻星系中的 暗物质加热证据. 
传统的测试暗物质的方式是用 星系的旋转曲线,但是由于加热效应 旋转速度中就会有了热运动的成分, 对于我没判断暗物质质量 有了干扰, 因此我没需要一个方法或者样本可以分离暗物质的影响部分. 介于此, 他们提出用矮星系是最佳材料, 质量低, 不会有较高恒星形成影响内部暗物质的密度轮廓, 其H的旋转曲线可以比较容易的从星系形成影响中分离出来.
 实际上这些找到的矮星系没有一个 的H 的旋转曲线可以用来动力学建模. 所以作者团队就想找到是为什么

多项证据 表面MW的盘可能形成的要比我们想象的早, 位于 恒星形成活跃区和宁静区的中间地带,它的质量中盘占据了主导而其他星系则是恒星质量主导(这也算???),以及它的位置 邻居是一个恒星形成的MC卫星星系.

第一阶段: 早期的盘星就有微弱的旋转角动量, 除了由本地恒星主导外,还有一部分来自早期并合的恒星主导,这一证据由 $[\alpha/Fe]$ 的在0.3的峰值处, 以及在金属丰度0的位置$\alpha$ 元素丰度处的小尾巴像是二者是一个过度演化关系.$\eta\sim 0.75$  

第二阶段: 自旋和冷却,真正的盘开始诞生.高$\alpha$ 星轨道圆化,并且分布逐渐集中,这个过程减少了随机的交会造成的轨道不稳定之类的,动力学冷却过程算是.有意思的是低$\alpha$的星本就大多数处于近圆状态. 所以在低$\alpha$里面金属丰度就不再适合作为年龄探针了.

Step 3: Heated old disk and in-situ halo. 意思是那些高$\alpha$星在转起来的同时,一部分就转成了in-situ stars

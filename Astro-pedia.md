##  ==Galactic cirri==
> the presenceof interstellar material from our own galaxy reflecting starlight(Elvey & Roach 1937; Henyey & reenstein 1941; Sandage1976; Mattila 1979) is unavoidable, thus harming the study of the faintest regions of galaxies. These filamentary clouds of dust, called “Galactic cirri”, have their peak emission in thefar-infrared due to their low temperature.

## ==Cosmic web==
The cosmic web is composed of interconnecting filaments of clustered galaxies and gases stretched out across the universe and separated by giant voids.  
Today, we see a Universe filled with large galaxies containing hundreds of billions of stars, clumped and clustered together into a massive cosmic web. Closer back in time to the Big Bang, however, everything was extremely smooth and uniform, with very little clumping or clustering to speak of.
[![|center|400](https://miro.medium.com/max/1050/0*00D1dx5xxMrkRHIy.jpg)]
Imagine the Universe as it was in these early stages. It’s full of matter and radiation that distributed almost perfectly evenly everywhere you look. In the aftermath of the Big Bang, a typically overdense region had 100.003% the average density, while a typically underdense one had 99.997% the average density. When we describe the early Universe as uniform, this is the level of uniformity we achieved.

But it doesn’t remain that way for long. Gravity immediately begins preferentially attracting mass into the overdense regions compared to all the others. The underdense regions more readily give up their matter to the surrounding, comparatively more dense regions.

简单说就是从均匀分布的热汤，到光子脱耦后产生重子物质，引力作用下聚合，随着宇宙一边加速膨胀同时形成恒星星系，早期那些微微小扰动也跟随长大。重子物质集中的地方就是节点，那些“空穴”但是也很多。

## ==Buckling instabilities==
In [structural engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_engineering "Structural engineering"), **buckling** is the sudden change in shape ([deformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deformation_(engineering) "Deformation (engineering)")) of a [structural component](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_component "Structural component") under [load](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_load "Structural load"), such as the bowing of a [column](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Column "Column") under [compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compression_(physics) "Compression (physics)") or the wrinkling of a plate under [shear](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shearing_(physics) "Shearing (physics)"). If a structure is subjected to a gradually increasing load, when the load reaches a critical level, a member may suddenly change shape and the structure and component is said to have _buckled_. 

In astronomy, buckling always refers to an dynamic process in the galaxy bars . Independently of origin of bar, strong bars tend to undergo an event of buckling instability during their evolution ([Combes & Sanders 1981](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R13); [Pfenniger & Friedli 1991](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R45); [Raha et al. 1991](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R47); [Athanassoula 2016](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R5); [Smirnov & Sotnikova 2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R49); [Łokas 2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R28)). The instability may occur more than once in the lifetime of a bar, with the second episode usually lasting longer and happening in the outer parts of the bar ([Martinez-Valpuesta et al. 2006](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R31)).The event leaves behind a distinct boxy/peanut shape in the inner part of the bar similar to bulges of some late-type galaxies ([Debattista et al. 2004](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R15); [Athanassoula 2005](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R3); [Bureau et al. 2006](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R9); [Yoshino & Yamauchi 2015](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R62); [Erwin & Debattista 2016](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R18), [2017](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R19); [Li et al. 2017](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R26); [Savchenko et al. 2017](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R48)). Buckling probably also took place in the bar of the Milky Way, as evidenced by the boxy/peanut structure ([Weiland et al. 1994](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R59); [Ciambur et al. 2017](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R12)), possibly leaving its traces in the presently observable phase-space ([Khoperskov et al. 2019](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/09/aa36056-19/aa36056-19.html#R25)).

## ==Bulge==
For many years, the Galactic bulge was considered as a structure built through mergers early in the formation of the Galaxy, now called a classical bulge. Particularly the old ages of bulge stars inferred from color-magnitude diagrams supported this view (Ortolani et al. 1995; Clarkson et al. 2008). Form Wikipedia: A **galactic bulge** (or simply **bulge**) is a tightly packed group of [stars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star "Star") within a larger star formation. The term almost exclusively refers to the central group of stars found in most [spiral galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy "Spiral galaxy")

## ==RCG==
Red clump giant star, so-called RCG,  another point noticeable: stars at one point on the RGB can be detected and is known as the RGB bump.
恒星演化的一个过程, 对于低质量恒星而言, 主序阶段经历的H核燃烧使得其温度升高光度增加, 同时核燃烧的产物He会在中心积累形成一个小He核, 当He核越长越大, 外面燃烧的H就越来越薄,人们会说H核心燃烧完成, 开始H壳层燃烧,其实是一个连续的过程, 不存在先后.只是为了方便区分亚巨星支和主序的一个划分而已,物理过程是连续的. 亚巨星阶段是He核开始从局部简并到外的过程, 到RGB的拐点其实类似于从主序到亚巨星的拐点一样,像是某种平滑被打破进入了另一个程序主导的过程. 只不过主序进入亚巨星是He核累积的程度(剩余H核燃烧占He-H核心占比程度)产生的主导变化,这里则是He核简并的程度带来的主导变化而出现了拐点,不意味着He完全简并,只能说几乎(也可以说主序拐点是H核几乎燃烧完全只剩下外面一点点,这里也是只剩下外面一点点没有简并,要是完全简并就快要He闪了). 然后便是进入了RGB阶段, RGB阶段由于He核几乎都处于简并,外面的H薄层燃烧会加快很多,导致温度不会继续冷却, 但是外面包层会膨胀更快, 带来的直接效果就是亮度陡然爬升,因此称之为 Ascending the red-giant branch.  直到He完全简并后, 继续累积的He核质量过高,电子简并压不足以抗衡引力, He核开始燃烧(低质量的恒星我们会称之为He闪,但是大质量恒星会在简并完全之前就会He核心开始燃烧,不会发生这种行为,但是本质上物理过程是一样的,只是外在看到的会有区别),瞬间使得He核解除简并.  温度开始升高, 由于不需要外面H包层来继续燃烧, 所以包层也会迅速收缩,自然便是光度一下子降低,. 由于简并的He核质量都差不多在 $0.5 M_\odot$ ,因此燃烧的温度光度几乎也都是差不多, 这就导致低质量的恒星在这一阶段在CMD上分布会呈现一个堆积趋势, 故称之为 Red clump giant star, RCG.

## ==Dynamical Friction==

## ==Lyman-break technique==
**Lyman-break galaxies** are [star-forming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_formation "Star formation") [galaxies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy "Galaxy") at high [redshift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redshift "Redshift"), radiation at higher energies than the [Lyman limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyman_limit "Lyman limit") at 912 ${\rm Å}$ is almost completely absorbed by neutral gas around star-forming regions of galaxies，而高于lyman 线 912 A 的部分就比较亮，于是就看到一个类似于"Break" 的效果. 这些高红移星系的辐射经历宇宙膨胀后，红移足够到地球大气不会吸收lyman线部分程度，所以可以用这种技术来认证高红移星系(精确的需要其他光谱线，而不是仅仅用lyman-break technique, Hubble 之前数据就被很多人用这种技术找到很多假的 高红移星系，如今JWST 出来又出现一堆人找到大量高红移星系，但这次估计是真的，毕竟JWST真的强)
## ==polar-ring galaxies==
A polar-ring galaxy is a type of galaxy in which an outer ring of gas and stars rotates over the poles of the galaxy. These polar rings are thought to form when two galaxies gravitationally interact with each other.

## ==Building Blocks==
In cosmological simulations, low-metallicity stars ([Fe/H]1≤ −2.5) form in the first 2–3 Gyr after the Big Bang, and mostly in low-mass systems, the so-called “building blocks", (Starkenburg et al. 2017a; El-Badry et al. 2018; Sestito et al. 2021)
## ==Nuclear star cluster==
Wiki explanation: A nuclear star cluster (NSC) or compact stellar nucleus (sometimes called young stellar nucleus) is a star cluster with high density and high luminosity near the center of mass of most galaxies.

## ==Critical curve==
In gravitational lensing system, the source was magnified by the foreground object(galaxy cluster or Super Massive Black Hole). In convenience, we use tensor $M$ denote the magnification:$$M^{-1} = \frac{\partial \theta_s}{\partial \theta} = \frac{\partial^2}{\partial\theta^2}T(\theta)$$
The determinant of $M$ can be thought of as a scalar magnification. The places where one of the eigenvalues of $M^{-1}$ becomes zero (and in consequence $|M| = infinite$) are in general curve and are know as critical curve.

## ==IDE Cosmology model==
One model that has gained popularity for potentially resolving the H0 tension is the interacting dark energy (IDE) scenario, where a non-gravitational interaction between dark matter (DM) and dark energy (DE) is postulated. 

$\Lambda CDM$ model has predicted an inflation period our universe experienced. This prediction has supported by amounts of Obs, including [[#CMB|CMB]] and the distribution of galaxies. However  some systematic errors in measurements of the CMB radiation, which will result an overestimate our curvature of space. This means the universe may have a positive or negative curvature. There it is too soon to exclude a flat universe or other possibilities.
